This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java. The `Bug.java` file contains the erroneous code, which attempts to access an array element beyond its valid index range.  The `BugSolution.java` file provides a corrected version, highlighting the importance of careful array index management.  This example is useful for illustrating and understanding a frequent source of runtime exceptions in array-based programming.
